One of my goals in life is to create something that matters together with the greatest minds of our times and to solve challenging and interesting technological problems while doing it.

## My inspirations

There are many inspirations and inspirational people in my life. A more or less random selection of the top of my head:

- Scientists like [Yann LeCun](http://yann.lecun.com/), [Geoffrey Hinton](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) or [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

- Social activists like [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) or organisations like [Field Ready](https://www.fieldready.org/)

- Psychologist and motivational speakers like [Tony Robbins](https://www.ted.com/talks/tony_robbins_asks_why_we_do_what_we_do) or [Carol Dweck](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve#t-73105)

- Entrepreneurs like [Tony Hsieh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hsieh) or [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk). I know it's lame but I also believe Steve Jobs was a genius :)

- Inventors like [Nikola Tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla) or [Thomas Edison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison)

- Mathematicians like [Bernhard Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann) or [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler)

My favourite inspirational quote at the moment is from Aaron Swartz:

> Be curious. Read widely. Try new things. What people call intelligence just boils down to curiosity.
