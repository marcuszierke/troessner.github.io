One of my goals in life is to create something that matters together with the greatest minds of our times and to solve challenging and interesting technological problems while doing it.

## My inspirations

There are many inspirations and inspirational people in my life. A more or less random selection of the top of my head:

- Scientists like [Yann LeCun](http://yann.lecun.com/), [Geoffrey Hinton](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) or [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

- Social activists like [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) or organisations like [Field Ready](https://www.fieldready.org/)

- Psychologist and motivational speakers like [Tony Robbins](https://www.ted.com/talks/tony_robbins_asks_why_we_do_what_we_do) or [Carol Dweck](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve#t-73105)

- Entrepreneurs like [Tony Hsieh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hsieh) or [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk). I know it's lame but I also believe Steve Jobs was a genius :)

- Inventors like [Nikola Tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla) or [Thomas Edison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison)

- Mathematicians like [Bernhard Riemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann) or [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler)

My favourite inspirational quote at the moment is from Aaron Swartz:

> Be curious. Read widely. Try new things. What people call intelligence just boils down to curiosity.

## What I bring to the table

- Excellence in software engineering. I’ve been doing this for the last 15 years and I’m obsessed with code quality and writing elegant, maintainable code. I am a regular open source contributor and maintainer of a couple of more or less popular gems. Most notably of the awesome [Reek](https://github.com/troessner/reek) gem - check out [my github profile](https://github.com/troessner/) for more. Additionally you can find quite a few mostly technical articles on [my blog](https://troessner.svbtle.com/).

- Building up teams by recruiting the best people. I'd go as far as to say that team play is 10 times more important than "being an expert" since it's far easier to become good at something than transitioning from being a douche to somebody who can carry and motivate a team. You can read up on my recruiting philosophy [here](https://troessner.svbtle.com/the-rockstar-ninja-and-you-a-laymans-guide-how-to-not-hire-them).

- Motivation and the passion to motivate others: I believe that vision and purpose on the high level, clear responsibilities and maximum autonomy are the keys to high productivity and happiness.

- The passion to create something that might change change the world. I don't care much for money - my motivation lies elsewhere. This doesn't mean that I work for free, just that I value other things more.

## My leadership philosophy

When it comes to leadership I have 2 core beliefs:

**What makes humans productive?**

- Sharing a common vision that means something to you and others.
- Clearly defined responsibilities. Not in a limiting "you're not allowed to do that" way but rather in a "I know who's taking care of what" way
- Maximum autonomy. Most startups get this part right because it's the easiest one. Unfortunately it's also the one that can quickly make people unproductive and unhappy when you fuck up the first two items

**What is leadership?**

- Vision. At least a third of your time should only be invested in developing, nurturing and communicating the vision.
- Mission. That does not mean being involved in the details. That means roadmap and high level metrics.
- Team building
